# Materials
Materials is a calculator for laying out materials in an efficient way to make sure little is wasted when their sawn.

## Get started

### Install a webserver
* Install any webserver for hosting locally. We will use Apache's Xampp distribution for this. You can download Xampp from https://www.apachefriends.org.
* Make sure your Xampp is configured and Apache is running. We won't need any services, so ignore those. For help with this, visit https://www.apachefriends.org/faq_windows.html.

### Clone the repository
* Navigate to the document root of your webserver. For Xampp this is the "xampp/htdocs" directory.
* Clone this repository in a new folder "materials".

### Start!
* Open any browser.
* Go to http://localhost/materials/. If you had to configure a specific port (because the default was already in use), make sure to include that, like this: http://localhost:81/materials/.


## Usage

## Updates
Updates are not downloaded automatically, so you will have to do that as follows:
* Run the `update.bat` file (double-click it), to manually update the calculator to the latest version.
